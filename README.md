# 🌧️ Weather Forecasting Project

This project analyzes rainfall and temperature trends using real-world weather datasets and time series forecasting techniques in Python.

## 📁 Files

- `Rain_Project.ipynb`: Rainfall data exploration, visualization and mapping.
- `Time_Series.ipynb`: Time series analysis using ARIMA/SARIMA for temperature prediction.
- `good_data.csv`, `rains_with_coordinates.csv`, `temp_series_data.csv`: Input data files used in the notebooks.

## 🧪 Tools & Techniques

- Jupyter Notebooks
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Statsmodels (ARIMA, SARIMAX)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Time Series Forecasting

## 📌 Notes

- Data was cleaned and explored before applying models.
- Forecasting is based on non-continuous time data with seasonal variation.
- All notebooks are runnable and self-contained.
